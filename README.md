# Chaos-Game
The Chaos Game is a method used to create a fractal, which is a pattern that repeats infinitely. In this approach, we start by defining the number of sides of the shape. Then, we randomly select two points within the shape, and at each iteration, we take the midpoint between the current position and one of those points. This process is repeated multiple times to visualize a complex pattern. Additional features of the Chaos Game include parameters such as the Division Factor, Number of Iterations, and Color, which add further complexity and customization to the generated fractal.
