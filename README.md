# Chaos Game

The Chaos Game is a fascinating method for generating fractals, intricate patterns that repeat infinitely. This repository contains an implementation of the Chaos Game algorithm, allowing you to explore and create mesmerizing fractal shapes.

## How it Works

The Chaos Game algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Shape Definition**: Specify the number of sides for the shape you want to generate a fractal for.

2. **Random Point Selection**: Randomly select two points within the shape.

3. **Iteration Process**: At each iteration, calculate the midpoint between the current position and one of the randomly selected points.

4. **Repeat**: Repeat the iteration process multiple times to visualize the complex fractal pattern.

## Features

The Chaos Game implementation in this repository includes several features for customization:

- **Division Factor**: Adjust the division factor to control the speed and complexity of the fractal generation process.

- **Number of Iterations**: Specify the number of iterations to determine the level of detail in the fractal.

- **Color**: Customize the color scheme of the generated fractal to enhance visualization.
